# Project 2: Text generation using Recurrent Neural Networks

## This is the third project assignment of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation: "Project 3:Generate TV Scripts"

In this project, I generated my own Simpsons TV script using Recurrent Neural Networks.
Using a part of the Simpsons kaggle dataset from season 27, the Neural Network created a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
